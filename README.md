# Squad Goals
### A mobile-first web app that holds you accountable to goals with the help of teammates and friends.

Ever find yourself having trouble sticking to daily goals? Have you ever made a promise to do X with a friend, only for both of you to lose motivation as time went on? Well despair no more because Squad Goals is here to help! Inspired by the psychological influence of Snapchat "streaks" and the power of camcamaraderie, I designed Squad Goals to help people follow daily routines as best as possible by leveraging support from others. As you complete bits of your goal throughout the day, log it on the app. The interface will display your progress to the rest of your team and push others to match you. If you see a teammate falling behind towards the end of the day, let them know! The larger the team, the more accountability everyone gets. Need a bonus incentive? Decide on rewards for teammates with the longest streak by the end of the week/month. You can even throw in a punishment for the person with the least streaks, if that's how you operate. Regardless, let us all put your best foot forward and achieve our goals while supporting each other along the way. Remember to share this app with your friends for maximum efficiency!
